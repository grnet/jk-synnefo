Hello everybody,

the schedule for [LinuxCon/CloudOpen Europe 2013](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudopen-europe) has just been announced and we are more than pleased to be a part of it.<!--break--> Vangelis from our team will be giving a talk/demo about Synnefo on Tuesday.

So, join us at CloudOpen 2013, to learn more about Synnefo and see how it is used in large scale production environments.

See you all in Edinburgh,  
Constantinos
