Hello everybody,

while celebrating the release of Synnefo v0.16.1 we're looking to expand our
[Use Cases page][1] with more success stories. If you've used Synnefo
to deploy a private or public cloud, we would love to hear your experiences
regarding the software.

Feel free to share your story on our [mailing list][2] or our [IRC channel][3]
and we'll add it to our Use Cases page.

Thank you,  
the Synnefo team
