Hello everybody,

the [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/virtualisation_and_iaas/) for the Virtualization and IaaS devroom of [FOSDEM 2014](https://fosdem.org/2014/) has been announced and we are more than happy to be a part of  it. After [last year's introduction](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/synnefo/), this year we will be talking about advanced storage integration on Synnefo with Archipelago and Ceph. Check out the talk abstract [here](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/virtiaas02/).

Of course, we will be making a quick intro to the stack for those who haven't heard about it before, and also do a live demo.

So, join us at the talk, we'll be happy to meet you.

See you all in Brussels.
