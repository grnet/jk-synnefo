[FOSDEM 2013](https://fosdem.org/2013/) is getting really close and we have two reasons to be happy about it. First of all because we are going to spend a very interesting and fun weekend by just attending, and second because we will be introducing Synnefo to the rest of the community!<!--break-->

Vangelis will be having a [talk](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/synnefo/) at the [cloud devroom](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/cloud/) introducing Synnefo to the masses, explaining its design and architecture, plus referring to the history of its last 2 years of development, and how we used it to provide a large scale production quality cloud service. He will also point out how Synnefo differs from the other famous cloud platforms.  
So, if you are also attending FOSDEM and would like to know more about Synnefo, feel free to join us at the talk. We will be glad to meet you. 

See you at FOSDEM.
