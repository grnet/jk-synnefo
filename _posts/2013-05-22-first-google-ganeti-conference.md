Hello everybody,

we are very pleased to announce that this year we are co-organizing the first Google Ganeti Conference: [GanetiCon 2013](https://sites.google.com/site/ganeticon/home/ganeticon2013)

The conference will take place between 3-5 September 2013 in [Athens, Greece](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=athens,+greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=59.249168,84.023438&amp;hnear=Athens,+Kentrikos+Tomeas+Athinon,+Greece&amp;t=m&amp;z=13) <!--break-->

The first GanetiCon will be a developers oriented conference, and it will mostly include design talks and discussions about new features and future plans. It will also probably feature an advanced Ganeti workshop, depending on user demand. Additionally, anybody who is interested in:

*   learning how other companies/institutions use Ganeti
*   checking out how large scale Ganeti deployments look like
*   glimpsing the product roadmap of Ganeti
*   contributing to future design of Ganeti
*   obtaining help with specific Ganeti issues<

should definitely attend.

Most developers of the Ganeti and Synnefo team will be there, so it will be a great chance to meet you all in person, and answer all your questions.

If this sounds exciting and you are interested in attending the first GanetiCon please fill out [the registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zWzNyY9O_4XRBYHejDPKCIH_NbsLEkGieln63T_BSyE/viewform) [CFP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cv3w70lRge6yqzvrP_wXc4CFRw-02FiC4M16V0sHNko/viewform).
