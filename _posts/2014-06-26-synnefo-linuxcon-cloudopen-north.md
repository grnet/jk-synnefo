Hello everybody,

we are happy to announce that this summer Synnefo will be crossing the Atlantic, landing for the first time officially in the US!  

Vangelis Koukis, from the team, will be giving a [talk](http://sched.co/1jQkrWt) at [LinuxCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america)/[CloudOpen](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudopen-north-america) North America 2014, introducing Synnefo to the American audience. <!--break-->

So, if you are around, we'd love to see you in Chicago, meet you in person and discuss all things Synnefo, Ganeti and "the Cloud".

On behalf of the Synnefo team, Constantinos
