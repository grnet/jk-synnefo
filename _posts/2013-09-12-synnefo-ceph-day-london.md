Hello everybody,

The [schedule for Ceph Day London](http://cephdaylondon.eventbrite.com/) has just been announced!<!--break-->

What's more, we will be presenting Synnefo at the event showing how we manage to unify cloud storage (Files, Images, VM disks) using *Synnefo + Ganeti + Archipelago + RADOS* in production.

We are also really excited to meet the guys from [Inktank](http://www.inktank.com/) and other Ceph users, learn and exchange opinions.

So, if you are in London and the above sound exciting, please join us at the event. 

See you in London.
